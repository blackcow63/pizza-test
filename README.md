# **What Kind of Pizza Are You?** README

## Overview
"What Kind of Pizza Are You?" is a fun web app designed to determine your pizza personality based on a mix of personal details and interests. Built using the Streamlit library, the app generates a specific type of pizza recommendation that aligns with your provided details.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The app requires you to input your:
   - Age
   - Years of school completed
   - Weight
   - Height
   - Continent of origin
   - Interests (e.g. Adventure, Music, Reading, Sports, Art)

2. **Calculation**: 
    - Each quantitative detail like age, years of school, weight, and height contributes to an overall score.
    - The continent you're from gives a specific increment to the score.
    - Your interests contribute additional values to the score.

3. **Result**:
    - Based on the final computed score, the app categorizes you into one of the four pizza types:
      - Margherita
      - Pepperoni
      - BBQ Chicken
      - Veggie

4. **Retake Option**:
    - If you'd like to change your answers and see a different result, simply click the "Retake" button.

## Note
The results generated by the app are purely for entertainment and should not be taken seriously. The app's logic is whimsical and not based on any scientific or psychological theories.

## Dependencies
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): The primary library used for creating the web app.

## Running the App
1. Make sure you have Streamlit installed.
   
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. To run the app, navigate to the directory containing the code and run:

   ```
   streamlit run filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the name you've saved the code as.

3. Open the provided link in your web browser to interact with the app.

# **Creating a Docker Image for the "What Kind of Pizza Are You?" App**

Docker is an essential tool for ensuring that applications run consistently across various environments. By creating a Docker image for our Streamlit app, you can easily share, deploy, and run the app without worrying about system-specific quirks or setup steps.

## Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

## Directory Structure:
Ensure your directory contains the following files:
- `app.py`: This is where the Streamlit code for the app resides.
- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions for Docker to build the image.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required by the app.

## Step-by-step Guide to Create a Docker Image:

### 1. Writing the Dockerfile:

Your `Dockerfile` should contain the following:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8501 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8501

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```

### 2. Building the Docker Image:

Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t pizza-app:latest .
```

Here, `pizza-app` is the name of the image, and `latest` is the tag. Adjust the names as you see fit.

### 3. Run the Docker Container:

After building the image, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 pizza-app:latest
```

Once the container is running, you can open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the Streamlit app.

## Sharing the Docker Image:
To share the Docker image with others or deploy it to a registry, you may want to push it to Docker Hub or any other container registry:

1. Log in to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker login
```

2. Tag the image:

```bash
docker tag pizza-app:latest username/pizza-app:latest
```

Replace `username` with your Docker Hub username.

3. Push the image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push username/pizza-app:latest
```

After pushing, others can pull and run your image from Docker Hub using the `docker pull` and `docker run` commands.

## Conclusion:
By following the steps above, you can easily containerize your Streamlit app with Docker, ensuring it runs consistently across various platforms.
