# **What Kind of Pizza Are You?** README

## Overview
"What Kind of Pizza Are You?" is a fun web app designed to determine your pizza personality based on a mix of personal details and interests. Built using the Streamlit library, the app generates a specific type of pizza recommendation that aligns with your provided details.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The app requires you to input your:
   - Age
   - Years of school completed
   - Weight
   - Height
   - Continent of origin
   - Interests (e.g. Adventure, Music, Reading, Sports, Art)

2. **Calculation**: 
    - Each quantitative detail like age, years of school, weight, and height contributes to an overall score.
    - The continent you're from gives a specific increment to the score.
    - Your interests contribute additional values to the score.

3. **Result**:
    - Based on the final computed score, the app categorizes you into one of the four pizza types:
      - Margherita
      - Pepperoni
      - BBQ Chicken
      - Veggie

4. **Retake Option**:
    - If you'd like to change your answers and see a different result, simply click the "Retake" button.

## Note
The results generated by the app are purely for entertainment and should not be taken seriously. The app's logic is whimsical and not based on any scientific or psychological theories.

## Dependencies
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): The primary library used for creating the web app.
- Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/). The Docker is necessary to create and run an image on a container.
